Proud of our IAF,0
Took months to announce how many Pakistani jets were downed,0
"Rahul pressured Modi, Air Chief misled media claiming 10-12 jets destroyed",0

Hope Mamata Banerjee stays quiet from our state,1
Any single guy here,0
"Hindu Mahasabha, Muslim League, Shyama Prasad opposed Quit India; Gandhi always hero. Jai Hind",0
From Quit India to now Quiet India movement,0
Where is BJP and Veer Savarkar?,0
Gandhi is original gangster,0
"RSS opposed Quit India movement, that is history",0
"He is Gandhi for India, Mahatma for Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Britain",0
People around Gandhi had no bodyguards; Modi calls himself poor leader and stays 1 km away,0
